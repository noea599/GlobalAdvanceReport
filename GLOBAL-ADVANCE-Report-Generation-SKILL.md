## MESSAGING & NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK

### **Core Messaging Principles**

**1. Changemaker-Centric**
Always frame stories around catalytic leaders (changemakers), not Global Advance.
- ✅ "Maria is igniting marketplace transformation in Lima"
- ❌ "Global Advance is transforming Lima's marketplace"

**2. Spiritual + Economic Capital**
Never separate these - always address BOTH dimensions.
- ✅ "Churches planted AND businesses launched"
- ❌ "Churches planted" (without economic dimension)

**3. Indigenous Leadership Emphasis**
Highlight national/local leaders, not American visitors.
- ✅ "Pastor John from Uganda is training 50 pastors"
- ❌ "Our team trained 50 pastors in Uganda"

**4. Great Commission Orientation**
Connect all activity to making disciples of nations.
- ✅ "This business network exists to advance the gospel"
- ❌ "This is a good business networking group"

**5. Kingdom Collaboration**
Emphasize partnership, not isolation.
- ✅ "Regional leaders are building collaborative strategies"
- ❌ "We are implementing our strategy"

### **Vocabulary Guidelines**

**Use These Terms:**

- Catalytic leaders
- Ignite/igniting
- Spiritual + economic capital
- Fulfill the Great Commission
- Indigenous/national leaders

- Nation-builders
- Marketplace missions
- Frontline leaders

**Avoid These Terms:**
- Beneficiaries (too passive)
- Recipients (implies one-way)
- Helping (implies superiority)
- Sending missionaries (not GA model)
- Our work (implies ownership)
- Charity (not partnership)

### **Tone Standards**

**Professional yet Passionate:**
- Not overly emotional or manipulative
- Not dry or academic
- Compelling storytelling with integrity
- Data-driven but story-illustrated

**Faith-Integrated:**
- Acknowledge God's work
- Scripture when appropriate
- Prayer language
